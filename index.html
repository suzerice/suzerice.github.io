			<h2>About Folktale Bakery</h2>
			<h3>A Castle of Gluten Free Cookies, Lemon Bars, and Sweets</h3>
			<h4>The Quest for Perfection</h4>
				<p>Gluten free cookies and sweets have a terrible reputation. When we would buy the latest and greatest boxed desserts from the supermarket, we'd commonly hear my friends say, "This is good for gluten-free." But why does it need to be "good for gluten-free"? Why can't it just be good? Or great? Just because we don't eat flour doesn't mean we should settle for anything less than fantastic. And so I had my quest - to create and share gluten-free treats that are so good you don't know they're gluten-free.</p>
			<h4>Who is Folktale Bakery?</h4>
				<p>Folktale Bakery consists of just two people - Susan, the baker, and her boyfriend, Garett, who's the willing taste-tester (it's a hard life, but someone has to do it!) with no dietary restrictions. Every recipe has passed two tests - Garett's stamp of approval for "Equal to or better than the flour equivalent", and the blind taste test of gluten-eating friends with the revelation of "Surprise, those cookies were gluten free" only after we've been told they're delicious. We're in Somerville and do this in our spare time because we love baking (well, I love baking and he loves eating!), so we appreciate any and all support.</p>
			<h4>Which cookies are your favorites?</h4>
				<p>We love them all! But Garett's favorite is the Chernobog (triple dark chocolate cookies). Susan's not a huge fan of chocolate (possibly heresy for a baker, but true all the same) and loves either the Chimeras (triple citrus bars) or the Snow Queens (almond cookies rolled in confectioner's sugar).</p>
