					<p>A local tale! Chocolate chip cookies were invented in Whitman, Massachussetts in 1938, by Innkeeper Ruth Graves Wakefield at the Toll House Inn. A classic for humans and trolls alike, keep a few of these on you in lieu of gold pieces to get you over bridges in life.</p>

			<h2>About Folktale Bakery</h2>
			<h3>A Castle of Gluten Free Cookies, Lemon Bars, and Sweets</h3>
			<h4>The Quest for Perfection</h4>
				<p>Gluten free cookies and sweets have a terrible reputation. When we would buy the latest and greatest boxed desserts from the supermarket, we'd commonly hear my friends say, "This is good for gluten-free." But why does it need to be "good for gluten-free"? Why can't it just be good? Or great? Just because we don't eat flour doesn't mean we should settle for anything less than fantastic. And so I had my quest - to create and share gluten-free treats that are so good you don't know they're gluten-free.</p>
			<h4>Who is Folktale Bakery?</h4>
				<p>Folktale Bakery consists of just two people - Susan, the gluten-free baker, and Garett, the kitchen-hand and willing taste-tester with no dietary restrictions. Every recipe has passed two tests - Garett's stamp of approval for "equal to or better than the flour equivalent" and a blind taste test with no-diet-restriction friends. We're in Somerville and do this in our spare time because we love baking, so we appreciate any and all support.</p>
			<h4>Which cookies are your favorites?</h4>
				<p>We love them all! But Garett's favorite is the Chernobog (triple dark chocolate cookies). Susan's not a huge fan of chocolate (possibly heresy for a baker, but true all the same) and loves both the Chimeras (triple citrus bars) and the Snow Queens (almond cookies rolled in confectioner's sugar).</p>
