					<h4>(Chocolate Chip Cookies)</h4>
					<p>A local tale! Chocolate chip cookies were invented in Whitman, Massachussetts in 1938, by Innkeeper Ruth Graves Wakefield at the Toll House Inn. A classic for humans and trolls alike, keep a few of these on you in lieu of gold pieces to get you over bridges in life.</p>

				<h4>The Quest for Perfection</h4>
					<p>Gluten free cookies and sweets have a terrible reputation. When we would buy the latest and greatest boxed desserts from the supermarket, we'd commonly hear my friends say, "This is good for gluten-free." But why does it need to be "good for gluten-free"? Why can't it just be good? Or great? Just because we don't eat flour doesn't mean we should settle for anything less than fantastic. And so I had my quest - to create and share gluten-free treats that are so good you don't know they're gluten-free.</p>
				<h4>Who is Folktale Bakery?</h4>
					<p>Folktale Bakery consists of just two people - Susan, the gluten-free baker, and Garett, the kitchen-hand and willing taste-tester with no dietary restrictions. Every recipe has passed two tests - Garett's stamp of approval for "equal to or better than the flour equivalent" and a blind taste test with no-diet-restriction friends. We're in Somerville and do this in our spare time because we love baking, so we appreciate any and all support.</p>
				<h4>Which cookies are your favorites?</h4>
					<p>We love them all! But Garett's favorite is the Chernobog (triple dark chocolate cookies). Susan's not a huge fan of chocolate (possibly heresy for a baker, but true all the same) and loves both the Chimeras (triple citrus bars) and the Snow Queens (almond cookies rolled in confectioner's sugar).</p>

		<h2>Ingredients (All Gluten-Free!)</h2>
		<div class="articles">
			<article class="onethirdside">
				<img src="images/batter.png" alt="">
				<h3>Ingredient Sourcing</h4>
			<p>Wherever possible, we use local ingredients. Not only is it great to support other small businesses, but we've found that local farmers really care about quality. For example, the butter comes from grassfed cows in Vermont, and the eggs come from free range chickens about an hour west.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="twothirdside">
					<h3>Everything We Bake Has Some Combination of the Following:</h3>
					<h4>Gluten free flour:</h4>
						<p>Brown Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, White Rice Flour, Potato Starch, Sorghum Flour, Arrowroot Starch, Guar Gum, Sweet Rice Flour, Rice Bran.</p>
					<h4>Baking Standards:</h4>
					<p>White sugar, light and dark brown sugar, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa powder, butter, almond flour [any sweets with almond flour will clearly be labeled]</p>
				<h4>Dark chocolate chips:</h4>
				<p>Unsweetened Chocolate, Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Milk Fat, Soy Lecithin- An Emulsifier, Vanilla.</p>
				<h4>Citrus Bar Specifics:</h4>
				<p>Oranges, Limes, Lemons</p>
				<h4>Allergen Disclaimer</h4>
					<p>Our kitchen is certified gluten-free and we make everything we can ourselves. Our baker has a large number of dietary restrictions and can eat everything we make with no problems. With that said, some things (such as chocolate chips) we simply have to buy. As such, please assume that all our baked goods have been produced on equipment that processes tree nuts, coconut, eggs, soy and milk.</p><p> Also, please consider the factors surrounding your sensitivity to the allergen. For example, if you buy our cookies unpackaged out of an open tray at a cafe or farmer's market, we can't promise flour from that cafe's kitchen or a neighboring stall hasn't blown into the air.</p>

	<h2>Sustainability</h2>
	<div class="articles">
		<article class="onethirdside">

						<p>When we realized that starting a gluten free bakery meant an incredible amount of individual wrapping to prevent cross-contamination, we were incredibly disheartened and considered giving up the entire idea. However, a friend pointed out that we could frame our mindset in a different way - if we did our best to be sustainable, then when presented with a choice of a gluten-free cookie wrapped in plastic versus our gluten-free cookie in sustainable packaging, we could hopefully help a switch to more sustainable packaging across the industry.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="twothirdside">

			<p>All our packaging is compostable - please compost! Check with your city on how. In Cambridge, compost is one of the weekly services offered with recycling and trash. In Somerville, you can opt in to composting. It's as simple as adding another bin in your kitchen and putting it out on the curb once a week. If you're at a total loss, you can bring your packaging back to us and we'll compost it for you.</p>

					<p>We chose compostable versus recyclable because our research found that (upon writing this) only about 9% of the 'recyclables' thrown into recycling bins are actually recycled. The rest are floating in the ocean or buried in landfills. Some factors that contribute to this are the lack of recycling infrastructure (many first world countries shipped their recyclables to China, but China has stopped taking them and few other places have the resources to mass recycle) and single stream recycling (without strict recycling rules, some people throw everything into recycling bins - in some places, recycling facilities have even seen diapers and used needles - resulting in an enormous increase in recycling contamination. For example, if someone throws a plastic cup filled with coffee in the recycling bin, instead of rinsing and cleaning that cup first, then everything else in the bin will get coffee on it - paper that would have been recyclable is now coated with coffee and simply trash).</p>
<p>Currently, we're using paper tape, beeswax wax paper, and recycled paper. Our labels are stamps with biodegradable ink. We're doing our best but know that we are not experts. If you have any suggestions on how our packaging could be more sustainable (or more affordably sustainable, because currently quite a bit of our overhead is going straight to the sustainable packaging), we really would love to hear from you.
