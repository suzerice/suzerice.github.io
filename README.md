## GARETT: Code for our bakery website!

### Looking at site

The site is live here - you can get to it from any computer (if it ever doesn't work, put a ? at the end). When you make any changes in GitHub, you can reload to see them immediately. 

[https://suzerice.github.io/index.html?](https://suzerice.github.io/index.html?)

(It's technically just https://suzerice.github.io/, but that's slower to update than the above if you make a change and want to see it immediately)

Ignore the .nojekyll file and the docs folder. They're just needed to make the website work on GitHub.

### Add any requests as an issue

To make life easy, we can just keep track of what we want to change on the site as an issue (then I'll have a queue to go change). You can also tag me on something with @. 

##### How? 

Click the "Issues" tab in the top right of the screen, underneath the name of the repo, next to "Code" which is the tab you're on by default. 

[Here is the documentation for creating issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).

### Making edits

You can make changes right in the browser and don't need to use terminal or download anything.

##### How?

You can just click on a file (you'll get to a preview of the file) and hit the edit pencil in the top right of the file; change whatever, and then when you're done, scroll to the bottom of the page where there's a "Commit Changes" panel. In the top box put something helpful like "Changed the text on the form", ignore the big box and the other options, click the green "Commit Changes".

[It's steps 1-5 here in the documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository) (we're ignoring the other steps because you'll already be logged in and you aren't using branches).
